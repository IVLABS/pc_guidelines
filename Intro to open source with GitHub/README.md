# How to work on opensource contribution with Git

## Making a contribution
1. Fork the repo which you want to work on (eg. https://github.com/take2rohit/sih_number_plate is original repo where you want to contribute) 
1. Clone the forked repository (not the above repo link)
`git clone https://github.com/your_userid/sih_number_plate`
3. Do your changes whatever you wish and commit 
`git add .`
`git commit -m "Adding my contribution"`
4. Push changes to GitHub. This updates your forked repo.
`git push origin master`
5. Create a pull request
6. If the owner find yours changes correct, he will merge it with his original repo.
7. Congo! You just did your first contribution to original repo

## Creating a new contribution to sane repo
1. Delete the old fork(if the master is ahed of your fok)
2. Create a new fork and do all changes there
3. Thats it!

This is an oversimplified way of contributing
For more advanced usage we can use branches and commands like adding upstream url and doing `git fetch`. You can google it learn for there itself.
